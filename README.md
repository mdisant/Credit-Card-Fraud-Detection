# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting


<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
## Description

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. 
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, 
where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

The objective of this project is to use a linear regression model to predict if a credit card transaction is fraudulent. Additionally, the project practices random oversampling 
and undersampling methods to deal with the highly unbalanced nature of the data.
